## Description
This repository contains all the scripts used for the calibration of Sentinel-2 vegetation phenology across Europe.

Sentinel-2 reflectance data were downloaded from Google Earth Engine: https://code.earthengine.google.com/c4d374f32991890c0b9d3395fe87429d. VIs are then calculated in R, followed by smoothing and phenometrics (SOS and EOS) extraction with the TIMESAT software. The final smoothed curves and phenometrics are stored as csv files.
